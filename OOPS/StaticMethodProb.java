/*Design a class called Participants with properties like Name, Phno,
Branch and University, TestResult_Classification[L1,L2,L3,L4,L5]. Create a
static method to display a message as follows based on the selection
criteria,
(i) If student test result classification is L1, congratulate the student
and inform that he/she has been selected for both Full time
intership as well as Full time job
(ii) If student test result classification is L2 or L3, inform the student
that he/she has been selected for Full time intership and Job
may be offered based on intership Performance.
(iii) If student test result classification is L4 or L5, inform that he/she
has been selected for Part time intership of 21 days.
Create atleast three Participants objects of array and then invoke static
method to display the message.
Note: Donâ€™t use if statement for conditional check, instead use Switch
Case statement.*/
